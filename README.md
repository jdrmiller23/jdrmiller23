ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jdrmiller23

I dabble in many things from design, development, and then back over to ice fishing, gardening and raising chickens (yes, I have very eccentric hobbies). I love learning new skills and techniques, and also building upon existing knowledge. 

Right now, I'm working with React and exploring SPAs, APIs and testing technologies.
